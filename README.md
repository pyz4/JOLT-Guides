## What is JOLT _Digest_?

The [_JOLT Digest_](http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest) is the online companion to the Harvard Journal of Law & Technology \([JOLT](http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/)\). It is intended to serve as a one-stop source of legal news to professors, practitioners, law students, and the general public on issues at the intersection of law and technology.

The Digest features short articles on new, precedential, or interesting cases; new legislation; administrative developments of note; and other interesting happenings. By applying JOLTâ€™s traditionally high editing standards to the Digest, we create a uniquely useful and trustworthy resource.
