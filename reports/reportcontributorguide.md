# Contributor's Guide

## Welcome to the Report Contributor's Guide!

This guide will provide an overview of your responsibilities as a **Contributor** of a **Digest Report**. Reports are short objective overviews, 500–700 words in length, of recent court opinions or pieces of legislation. They also provide links to primary sources and additional commentary for readers who want to dig deeper.

Subject Matter Coordinators \(SMCs\) are constantly looking for cutting edge developments in law & technology. They will assign the topic to you and a Report Editor. Your job is to write the substantive content of the report while the Report Editor will help you ensure it is publication-ready.

#### SUMMARY

**Assignment Date:** February 17, 2018

**Assignment:** summarize Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Software, Inc., No. 2017-1452, 2018 WL 843288 \(Fed. Cir. Feb. 14, 2018\) along with links to at least two outside sources. You can find examples of posts at [https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/category/?cat=patent](https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/category/?cat=patent).

**Draft Deadline** \(Contributor send draft to me and Editor\): 11:59 pm on Thursday, Feb 21.

**Edits Deadline** \(Editor send marked up draft to me and Contributor\): noon on Sat, Feb 24.

Thanks for writing for Digest this semester! According to the Fall 2017 Report Schedule, &lt;**Contributor**&gt;, you have been assigned the role of Digest Contributor for this week. **&lt;Editor&gt;**, you are assigned the role or Report Editor. 

**ASSIGNMENT**  
&lt;**Contributor&gt;**, your task is to summarize Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Software, Inc., No. 2017-1452, 2018 WL 843288 \(Fed. Cir. Feb. 14, 2018\). 

At issue here is whether the patented technology should have been patent-eligible. 35 U.S.C. § 101 defines what may be patented. Courts have consistently held that abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural phenonmenons are not patentable. The question then often turns on what falls in each of these three categories. Though commonplace, the issue is probably the most fundamental question in patent law and supported by one of the least defined doctrines in the field. 

You will almost certainly come across the Alice test. Courts applying the test engage in a two-step inquiry. In step one, courts figure out whether the matter at issue falls in one of the three patent-ineligible categories: abstract idea, laws of nature, or natural phenomenon. If not, then it is patentable. If so, then the courts ask whether there is an "inventive concept" that "transforms" the patent-ineligible matter into something "more" that is patentable. Readers will be most curious about the facts the courts considered in reaching their decisions on each of these steps.

**&lt;Editor&gt;**, your job is to ensure the report is substantively accurate and give suggestions on big picture flow. Defer to the Contributor on writing style.

This can be a very confusing case so don't hesitate to email me with any questions.  
You'll find the case at [http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/17-1452.Opinion.2-12-2018.1.PDF](http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/17-1452.Opinion.2-12-2018.1.PDF) \(also attached\). You can find other Federal Circuit cases at [http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/search/report.html](http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/search/report.html). 

In addition to summarizing the case, your article should also include at least 2 hyperlinks to related material and/or commentary. These can include briefs \(filed by the party or amicus\), legal blogs, JOLT articles or Digest posts, news articles.

You can find an example of a Digests post [here](http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/two-way-media-v-comcast).

You should follow the appropriate Digest Report guides: [Style & Citations Guide](reportstylecitation.md), [Contributor's Guide](reportcontributorguide.md), and [Editor's Guide](reporteditorguide.md). On occasion, the Style Guide requires you to follow the Bluebook \(though we never pincite\). JOLT maintains several online bluebook accounts to help with that process. Log-in with the following credentials at [www.legalbluebook.com](http://www.legalbluebook.com/).

Accounts: \[excluded\]

Password: \[excluded\]

**&lt;Contributor&gt;**, please send **&lt;Editor&gt;** and me your draft by 11:59pm Wed, Feb 21. **&lt;Editor&gt;**, please send the marked up draft to **&lt;Contributor&gt;** and me by 11:59pm Sat, Feb 24. Requirements are listed in your corresponding guides. Please follow them closely.

Lastly, Digest is looking to constantly improve the publication process. If you find any part of it confusion -- the requirements, guides, communication, etc. -- please let us know so that we can make adjustments.

#### Your Responsibilities

After receiving your assignment from the Subject Matter Coordinator \(SMC\), immediately "reply all" to the email and:

1. Confirm to the Coordinator and Editor that you have received and can complete the assignment.
2. Alert the Coordinator and Editor to any problems that may delay your submission
{% endhint %}

If you simply cannot write the report within the required time, please let the SMC know as soon as possible so the SMC can find another Contributor. Note that you may not have the opportunity to write a Digest report at a later time.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Want to choose a different topic?**

**Please let your SMC know within 24 hours of receiving your assignment.** A Report topic should be timely and related to law and technology.

Please include a link to the primary source and at least two links to other commentary on the topic in your email to your SMC. The SMC reserves the right to reject unsuitable topics.
{% endhint %}

## Step 3: Drafting the Report <a id="step3"></a>

The purpose of Digest Reports is to provide a relatively brief and ideologically-neutral overview of their subject.

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Your Responsibilities

1. Read the original source provided in the assignment email
2. Draft an impartial summary of the assignment email
3. Include in the summary **two** links to outside sources
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Instructions" %}
As a Contributor, you are responsible for the technical and substantive accuracy of the report. Refer to the [Style & Citations Guide](reportstylecitation.md) for:

1. What to look for in a case or legislation
2. How to format citations
3. Style guidelines

**Please be very careful** not to overstate or misrepresent the source. Digest Reports are often on the first page of Google inquiries for cutting-edge cases — getting it wrong has consequences. If you are unsure how to summarize a particular point, please ask for help. If all else fails, consider paraphrasing or quoting the source.

Visit [Digest](https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/category/?cat=reports) for examples of edited reports. [Here](http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/federal-circuit-flash-digest-basf-corp-v-johnson-matthey-inc) are [several](http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/teva-v-eli-lilly-teva-argues-lilly-is-infringing-migraine-drug-patent-in-the-united-states) [examples](http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/ubers-august-settlement-with-the-ftc-and-new-data-insecurity-revelations).

**Length** - while the report’s length will vary with the complexity of the subject, generally the report should be no longer than 500–700 words. The purpose of the report is to provide an accurate overview of the most important aspects of the subject. Readers interested in further detail can visit the primary and secondary sources that will be included.

**Google Docs** - Please use Google Docs to draft, share, and edit your piece.

### Report Structure & Organization

Please ensure that each submission adheres to the general organizational format described below. Contributors should not include their own independent analysis of the subject. **Any analysis** in the report should be clearly attributed to the source: either the _court_ \(by so stating\) or to an _author_ \(by linking to the source\). The standard structure is as follows.

1. **Report Title** beginning with the colloquial case name;
2. **By-line**, including names of the Contributor and the Editor;
3. **Citation** to the subject, in the standard Digest format, and a hyperlink to the primary source;
4. **Opening Synopsis**
   * Brief description of the subject \(one or two sentences\)
   * Short summary of the principal holdings, important legislative provisions, or reasons why the event being described is important \(one or two paragraphs\)
5. **Other Analysis**
   * Description of the subject \(see the resources following this structure for more subject-specific information\)
   * Significance of subject according to the source \(case--court; legislation--legislature\)
   * Significance of subject according to secondary sources \(e.g. expert blogs\)
6. **Additional Resources**
   1. Commentary: news articles, if accurate, & scholarly comment
   2. Related materials
7. Optional: one line describing yourself and your interests which will be included at the end of your contributor post. e.g. "\[Contributor’s name\] is a \(1L, 2L, 3L\) at the Harvard Law School."

## Step 4: Edits to the Report <a id="step4"></a>

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Your Responsibilities

1. Comment sections of your Report that you believe need a closer review
2. Share your draft on Google Doc
3. Work with the Editor to finalize the piece
4. Be available for any follow-up edits from the Subject Matter Coordinator 
{% endhint %}

Please share your draft on Google Doc with the following:

* Report Editor
* Assigning Subject Matter Coordinator
* Digest Account \(joltdigest@mail.law.harvard.edu\)

The easiest way to do this is to share a link in the assigning email thread. The Editor will have about three days to add comments and suggestions in the Google Doc. Please review them, finalize the draft, and notify the assigning SMC \(via the email thread\). The SMC will take another look and may offer an additional round of edits. You and the Editor will be asked to review the Report one last time before it is published. 

## Step 5: Feedback 

{% hint style="warning" %}
**You must fill out the feedback form to receive substantive feedback on your writing.** 
{% endhint %}

After the Report is published online, you will get an email from the Digest Reports Editor with a link and a feedback form. We ask for your feedback on: 

1. Your experience writing the Report \(to help us improve the process\)
2. Your experience working with the SMC and Editor \(to help us make promotion decisions\)

We also provide the opportunity to give **anonymous** feedback to your Editor. The Digest Reports Editor will combine their feedback with your feedback and the SMC's. The feedback you receive will be similarly anonymized. 

## Thank you!
