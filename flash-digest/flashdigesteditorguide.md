## Step 1: Getting Started {#step1}

You, the _Digest_ Report Editor, along with the Contributor, will be assigned a report during the week you indicated availability \(in the sign-up survey\). Contributors will have 72 hours to submit a draft to the Report Editor, and the Report Editor will have 72 hours to submit the edited article to the Contributor, Content Editor, and Digest Content Editor \(\).

Report Editors are expected to be available to complete assignments at any time that they have indicated that they are available. In the event you are unable to complete an assignment, please notify the assigning Content Editor immediately. If your availability changes during the year, notify the Digest Executive Editor \(\).

## Step 2: Receiving AND Confirming Receipt of Your Assignment {#step2}

The Content Editor will send you and the Contributor an assigning email with:

1. Name of the Contributor and Report Editor
2. Due date of article draft
3. Description of your and the Contributor's responsibilities
4. Instructions regarding choosing topics

If the email is missing any information OR you have questions: immediately contact your Content Editor.

> After receiving your assignment from the Content Editor, immediately “reply all” to the email and-  
> 1. Confirm to the Content Editor and Report Editor that you have received and can complete the assignment.  
> 1. Alert the Content Editor and Report Editor to any problems that may delay your submission.

If you simply cannot edit the report within the required time, please let the Content Editor know as soon as possible so the Content Editor can find another Report Editor.

## Step 3: Managing {#step3}

While the Contributor drafts the article, you play a vital support role in fielding questions and following up with help. You should receive an email from the Contributor with his or her chosen topics for the week. During the **3-day assigning period**, you should read the original source documents to familiarize yourself with the topic and facilitate the editing process.

> ### danger::Your Responsibilities

> Upon receipt of your assignment, you should: 1. Read the original source item and commentary 1. Be available via email to field questions from your Contributor 1. Follow-up if the Contributor does not meet the assignment due date

If the Contributor has questions about the process or trouble meeting their deadline, forward their question immediately to the Content and Executive Editors. If questions are minor, answer the question yourself and cc the Digest Content Editor \(\).

## Step 4: Editing {#step4}

> ### default::Pro Tip

> Visit _Digest_ at [http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/](http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/) to view published Flash Digest reports.
>
> * [Here](http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/flash-digest-news-in-brief-1) are [several](http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/flash-digest-news-in-brief-3) [examples](http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/flash-digest-week-of-march-20).

As an Report Editor, you will work with the Contributor to make sure the article is publication-ready. You are responsible for verifying the technical and substantive accuracy of the article. You are also responsible for suggesting tags.

Refer to the [Citation, Style, and Substance Guide](../reports/reportstylecitation/) for: 1. What to look for in a case or legislation 1. How to format citations 1. Style guidelines

You will have **three days** to edit the article after receiving it from the contributor. Enter your edits using “track changes” and submit the redlined version according to Step 5 below. The article you submit should be ready to post; if you have any questions, ask and resolve them before submitting the final draft. Highlight areas you remain uncertain. Offer your best explanation and your reasoning. If you submit a document that is highlighted but fail to offer an explanation, the Content Editor will return it to you for further research.

## Step 5: Moving the Report Forward {#step5}

Reply all to the email thread begun by your contributor and ensure that everyone listed below are included as recipients:

* Contributor
* Assigning Content Editor
* Digest Content Editor \(\)
* Digest Executive Editor \(\)

**Attach the following to the email:**

* the Report in .doc format with tracked-changes \(for the Contributor to see your edits\),
* PDF copy of the primary source material \(i.e. the legislation or case\)

**The body of your email should include the following**

* A summary of your edits and reasoning
* Any questions/concerns that arose during writing and editing \(e.g. you were unsure about what the opinion held, etc.\). Highlight sections of your Report that you believe require closer review and attention from your Report Editor.
* Optional: if you would like to be tagged by JOLT over social media, please include your Facebook or Twitter handle.

## After the Article is Posted

Both you and the Contributor will receive an email containing a permanent link to the entry. After you receive this link, please:

* Double-check the article to make sure you & the author are properly attributed in the “written by” and “edited by” bylines.
* Double-check that all links work.
* Ensure that no typos or other errors were introduced during the editing process.

## Thank you!
