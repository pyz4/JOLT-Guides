# FAQ

## How can I get involved with Digest? 

**Harvard Law Students** can write Reports, Notes, or Commentary. Sign up to write or edit a Report at the beginning of each semester. Join the [JOLT mailing list](https://test.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=fd5e177723c7929c4cc46bab1&id=dacf20620a) to know when to sign up. 

**Other Law Students and Recent Graduates** can write Notes or Comments. 

**Academics, Practitioners, and Other Professionals** can write Comments. 

We accept submissions for Notes and Comments all year round. Please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/mC9Tw2sRYxHjA2JV9), and we will contact you. 

If you have any questions, please email joltdigest@mail.law.harvard.edu.

## What is the difference between Reports, Notes, and Comments? 

**Reports** are short objective overviews, 500–700 words in length, of recent court opinions or pieces of legislation.

**Notes** provide a novel analysis on an issue related to law and technology. These are formal pieces that include Bluebooked citations and published in PDF format. They are comparable to JOLT's print publication student notes but shorter in length \(1,500–2,000 words for a Digest note, 4,000–6,000 words for a print note\). 

**Comments** are about 2,000 words and can come in several general forms: opinion pieces, primers, or responses. They allow the author to participate in ongoing discussions about cutting-edge legal issues without the formality of our Notes or the impartiality of our Reports.
